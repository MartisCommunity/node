# Welcome to Martiscoin

Martis comes from Latin, meaning "Mars".

[Martiscoin](https://martiscoin.net/) is a :sparkles: Groundbreaking Layer 1 :sparkles: , is inspired by Musk’s Mars immigration plan and Musk’s 2021 tweets on X ([Here](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1361709250561642498)). The goal is to use innovative, cutting-edge algorithms to enable true decentralized finance in a future on Mars.

Martiscoin have developed a brand new mining algorithm (XmarsHash) to combat ASCI miners and Mining pools, a dynamic X13+SHA512 algorithm (supports CPU/GPU).

The centralization problem is essentially a wealth distribution problem! Martiscoin builds a new distribution mechanism (interval reward distribution mechanism) based on the underlying economic model to solve the centralization problem. Centralization cannot bring greater economic benefits. Therefore, the willingness to decentralize will be greatly reduced, thereby ultimately achieving the goal of decentralization.

# Community Driven

Martiscoin was abandoned by its creator and is now being continued as a fully anonymous and decentralized community project.
